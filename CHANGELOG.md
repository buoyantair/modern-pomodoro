### BREAKING CHANGES

* This is the first step towards re-implementing modern-pomodoro app using
VueJS. I'm planning to slowly develop the app on develop branch and then
over time once I have a decent application I will merge it with master.

This app is my attempt at building a feature complete application
with clean & tested UI.
